# **Tari.ai ‚Äì AI-Powered DCA Investment Platform**

Tari.ai is a proof-of-concept platform built during a hackathon to explore how AI and blockchain can work together to automate crypto investing. The system transforms natural language inputs into on-chain actions by combining document understanding, AI coordination, and smart contract execution.

## **üîç How It Works**

**Document Understanding (Upstage API)** Users input financial news or commands. The Upstage API parses the text and extracts sentiment or DCA instructions.

**AI Coordination (RL Swarm-inspired)** Multiple AI agents (simulated using OpenAI APIs) perform collaborative reasoning: answering, critiquing, and resolving investment strategies.

**Smart Contract Execution (Rootstock)** The AI consensus is sent to a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Rootstock mainnet. It adjusts and executes a DCA investment based on the input.

**Frontend Interface (Next.js)** A unified UI lets users upload input, view AI reasoning, and execute on-chain transactions. Real-time feedback and error handling are built in.

## **üí° Why It Matters**

Simplifies crypto investing through plain-language interaction.

Uses multi-agent reasoning for more balanced decisions.

Bridges AI insight directly into decentralized finance.
